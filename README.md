# Chu-Nom-IME
An IME for Chu Nom with some Quoc Ngu functionality

The dict.yaml file contains all the compounds, characters and their alternatives from chunom.org's website. This means that it is by no means comprehensive, and can be added to by adding the character to the relevant section of the file, pressing TAB and then adding its Quoc Ngu reading. If there are multiple readings, this process will need to be repeated for each one.

The Quoc Ngu IME's functionality is limited, and can be improved by adding new words to the #Quoc Ngu section, pressing TAB and repeating them again.

Some characters may not display correctly. This can be fixed by installing one of these fonts: https://www.chunom.org/pages/fonts/

This IME requires RIME to work - this can be downloaded here https://rime.im/. I have written a guide to setting it up on this reddit page (this is for setting up another IME, but the principles are the same). If you run into any problems, you can seek help in this Discord server: https://discord.gg/BFbnZvp.
